The repository consists of 5 main folders:
1. "Control_DEM" is only needed for interacting with the DEM.
2. "Datenauswertung" contains all files to calculate and display the characteristics. 
3. "Kennlinie" contains the characteristics stored as matlab functions of the separation unit
4. "Offline Optimization" calculates the optimal control variables and the maximal improvement of an objective function. It requires the folder "Kennlinie"
5. "Simulink" contains the Simulink model. The model is opened by opening the project file "Simulink.prj". It requires the folders "Kennlinie", "ressources" and "slprj".
